      <p>
        I've fixed the "Page not found" errors by creating the missing implementation guide pages for the "Established"
        maturity level for all domains. The issue was that these pages were referenced in the navigation but didn't
        actually exist in the file structure.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Incident & Problem Management established guide</li>
        <li>Knowledge & Data Management established guide</li>
        <li>Change & Deployment established guide</li>
        <li>Infrastructure & Tooling established guide</li>
        <li>Service Management established guide</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Structure of Each Page</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A maturity banner showing the current level</li>
        <li>Key focus areas for the maturity level</li>
        <li>Implementation steps</li>
        <li>Templates and resources</li>
        <li>Expected outcomes</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Now when you navigate to these pages from either the Playbook domain list or the maturity recommendations, you
        should no longer see "Page not found" errors.
