// This is a temporary file to analyze the structure - it won't be included in the final project

/*
Current File Structure Analysis:

1. Domain Pages Structure:
   - /app/playbook/domains/[domain]/page.tsx (Domain overview)
   - /app/playbook/domains/[domain]/[band]/page.tsx (Band-specific implementation guides)

2. Potential Duplication Areas:
   - Domain-specific client components (e.g., RiskComplianceDomainPageClient.tsx)
   - Implementation guide pages with similar structures
   - Route handlers with similar functionality
   - Utility functions that might be duplicated across files

3. Naming Inconsistencies:
   - Some domains use hyphens (risk-compliance) while routes use different formats
   - Some client components have domain-specific names while others are generic
*/

// Potential issues found:

// 1. Domain URL inconsistencies:
// - /playbook/domains/incident-problem vs /playbook/domains/incident-management
// - /playbook/domains/continuity-resilience vs /playbook/domains/service-continuity
// - /playbook/domains/knowledge-data vs /playbook/domains/knowledge-governance

// 2. Potential duplicate templates or components:
// - Domain overview pages might have duplicate structures
// - Implementation guide pages might have duplicate structures
// - Multiple client components with similar functionality
